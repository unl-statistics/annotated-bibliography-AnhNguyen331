# Potential Major Gaps

Overall, the article is comprehensive and well organized, especially in its coverage of data sources, statistical methods, and emerging technologies in humanitarian contexts. One potential gap is the limited discussion of how these statistical tools are actually used by practitioners on the ground during real-time decision-making. While ethical concerns are mentioned throughout the paper, they could be developed more systematically rather than being revisited in scatter sections. Additionally, future applications focus heavily on technological advances, with less attention to organizational or capacity constraints that may limit their adoption.
