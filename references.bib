	abstract = {This article examines the role of statistics in the humanitarian sector, with a particular focus on disasters caused by natural hazards. It begins by outlining current applications, including primary data collection, anticipatory action frameworks, Earth observation, mobile positioning data, and artificial intelligence. It then highlights key challenges such as gaps and biases in disaster impact and response data, difficulties in communicating statistical findings clearly, inequities in aid allocation, and the widespread outsourcing of statistics-related work. In exploring future applications, the article discusses the potential of impact-based early warning models, dynamic population data, and artificial intelligence to enhance communication and decision-making. Throughout, emphasis is placed on the need for interoperable systems as well as ethical and inclusive data practices. In doing so, the article presents statistics as both a diagnostic and strategic tool for strengthening the effectiveness, fairness, and responsiveness of humanitarian action in disaster contexts.},

	abstract = {The convergence of artificial intelligence ({AI}) and Earth observation ({EO}) technologies has brought geoscience and remote sensing into an era of unparalleled capabilities. {AI}’s transformative impact on data analysis, particularly derived from {EO} platforms, holds great promise in addressing global challenges, such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and climate change analysis. However, the rapid integration of {AI} necessitates a careful examination of the dimensions of responsibility inherent in its application within these domains. In this article, we represent a pioneering effort to systematically review the intersection of {AI} and {EO}, with a central focus on responsible {AI} practices. Specifically, we identify several critical components guiding this exploration from both academia and industry perspectives within the {EO} field: {AI} and {EO} for social good, mitigating unfair biases, {AI} security in {EO}, geoprivacy and privacy-preserving measures, and also maintaining scientific excellence, open data, and guiding {AI} usage based on ethical principles. Furthermore, the article explores potential opportunities and emerging trends, providing valuable insights for future research endeavors.},
